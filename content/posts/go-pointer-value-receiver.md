title: 'The pointer receiver and value receiver in Go are just syntax sugar'

If you are a Gopher, you probably heard some advice that goes like this: when you edit a value then use a pointer receiver, when you read use a value receiver. Thatâ€™s not always correct and you should be careful when using them.

## Issue

Today I encountered an issue which can be simplified by the bellow code snippet:
```go
package main
 
import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)
 
type Counter struct {
    Count int
}
 
// Method with pointer receiver
func (c *Counter) Increment() {
    go func() {
        for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
            c.Count++
            time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
        }
    }()
}
 
// Method with value receiver
func (c Counter) Display() {
    go func() {
        for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
            fmt.Println("counter value: ", c.Count)
            time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
        }
    }()
}
 
func main() {
    c := Counter{Count: 0}
    c.Display()
    c.Increment()
 
    time.Sleep(15 * time.Second)
    fmt.Println("counter final value: ", c.Count)
}
```
I have a struct with two methods, `Increment` uses the pointer receiver to change the property of the struct, and `Display` uses the value receiver to read the value from the struct. Here is the result:
```
âžœ go run .
counter value:  1
counter value:  1
counter value:  1
counter value:  1
counter value:  1
counter value:  1
counter value:  1
counter value:  1
counter value:  1
counter value:  1
counter final value:  11
```
Both methods concurrently edit and read the counter, but the method of Display can only show the counterâ€™s initial value. Why does that happen?

It turns out that because of the value receiver of the method `Display`. When you call that method, it will create a **copy** of the `Counter` struct and operate on that copy. The `Increment` method changes the count on the original `Struct`, while the `Display` method reads from a **copy** of the Counter struct. Basically, two methods now are operating on two different struct instances.

To fix the issue, just use the pointer receiver in the `Display` method, and now both methods are operating on the same copy of the struct.

An another pattern is when you by mistake call an *pointer receiver method* inside an *value receiver method*, like this:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type Counter struct {
	mData map[int]int
	sData []int
}

// Method with pointer receiver
func (c *Counter) Put(i int) {
	c.mData[i] = i
	c.sData = append(c.sData, i)
	fmt.Println("Put mData=", c.mData)
	fmt.Println("Put sData=", c.sData)
}

// Method with value receiver
func (c Counter) Do() {
	// call api and get data
	i := 2
	c.Put(i)
}

func main() {
	c := Counter{mData: map[int]int{1: 1}, sData: []int{1}}
	c.Do()
	fmt.Println("main mData=", c.mData)
	fmt.Println("main sData=", c.sData)
}
```
The output:
```
Put mData= map[1:1 2:2]
Put sData= [1 2]
main mData= map[1:1 2:2]
main sData= [1]
```
This case is quite confusing when number 2 appears in the map, but disappear in the list ðŸ˜‚ The fix is similar to previous case, make the `Do` method become pointer receiver.
## Sugar syntax

In Go, *methods* are just sugar syntax. To make things easier to understand, I rewrite the two methods as below:
```go
// Function with pointer args
func Increment(c *Counter) {
    go func() {
        for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
            c.Count++
            time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
        }
    }()
}
 
// Function with value args
func Display(c Counter) {
    go func() {
        for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
            fmt.Println("counter value: ", c.Count)
            time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
        }
    }()
}
```
## Method expression
Go also has something called `Method Expressions`, I can rewrite the main function as below:
```go
func main() {
    c := Counter{Count: 1}
 
    display := Counter.Display
    display(c)
    inc := (*Counter).Increment
    inc(&c)
 
    time.Sleep(15 * time.Second)
    fmt.Println("counter final value: ", c.Count)
}
```
From the code, you can see, that I can convert methods to functions, and pass the struct to the functions as the addition argument.
