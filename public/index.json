[{"content":" a linked list If we use two pointers slow and fast, the first one moves forward one step at a time, and the second one moves forward two steps at a time. Eventually, the two pointers will meet somewhere. In the above example, they meet at number 9 (or G).\nG is where two-pointers fast and slow meet.\nE is the entrance of the loop.\nS is the first node of the linked list.\nF is the distance from the chain’s beginning to the loop’s entrance (from S to E). (eg: 1 – 3 – 5)\na is the distance from the loop’s entrance to the point where two pointers meet (from E to G). (eg: 5 – 6 – 7 – 8 – 9)\nC is the length of the loop. (eg: the loop is 5 – 6 – 7 – 8 – 9 – 10, the length is 6 )\nThe total distance that the slow pointer has moved is $F + a + xC$. $x$ is the number of times the slow pointer completes the loop.\nThe total distance that the fast pointer has moved is $F + a + yC$. Likewise, $y$ is the number of times the fast pointer completes the loop.\nSince the fast pointer moves two steps at a time, its distance will be double the slow pointer’s distance.\n\\[2*(F + a + xC) = F + a + yC\\] \\[2F + 2a + 2xC = F + a + yC\\] \\[F + a + 2xC = yC\\] \\[F + a = yC – 2xC\\] \\[F + a = (y – 2x)C\\] Denote $n = y – 2x, n \\ge 0$ \\[F + a = nC\\] $nC$ means to complete the loop (length is C) n times\nIn other words, if we have two pointers a and b, a starts at beginning of the chain (node S), b starts at where slow and fast pointers meet (node G), and both two new pointers move one step at a time. The first pointer moves a distance equal to $F + a$, and the second pointer moves a distance equal to $nC$, they will meet at G.\n\\[F + a= (n – 1)C + C\\] \\[F + a= (n – 1)C + (C – a) + a\\] \\[F = (n – 1)C + (C – a)\\]\nThis means, that if pointer a starts from the beginning of the chain (node S), pointer b starts from where two pointers slow and fast meet (node G).

Definition set is a collection of unique elements. the word disjoin means non-overlapping – two sets are considered as disjoining if they have no element in common disjoin-set contains a collection of non-overlapping sets it has two method find(x): return the representative element of the set that contains of x if u and v are in the same set, find(u) = find(v) union(u, v): merge two sets that contain u and v after merging, find(v) = find(u) 2.

Minimum spanning tree A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.[1] That is, it is a spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible.[2] More generally, any edge-weighted undirected graph (not necessarily connected) has a minimum spanning forest, which is a union of the minimum spanning trees for its connected components.\n-Wikipedia\nMST For example, if we want to find MST of the graph on the above image, here is the algorithm:\nn is the number of edges, and v is the number of nodes. Init a Disjoin set with v sets corresponding with v nodes of the graph. In other words, if we have 10 nodes, we will have 10 sets in the Disjoin set. Our target is to merge these v sets into just one single set representing that all nodes are connected. Sort the edges in the graph in accessing order of weight. You probably can use a priority queue for this purpose, so you can always get the shortest edge first, and then the longer ones. iterates through every edge in the priority queue: call e1 and e2 are two nodes that make up the edge if find(e1) == find(e2), it means both node e1 and node e2 are connected already, so we won’t need this edge skips this edge if find(e1) != find(e2), e1 and e2 now are in the different set, in other words, they are not connected. union(e1, e2) we can early stop the algorithm by checking if all v nodes are connected.

The database is still need to perform a sequence scan to scan all rows in table to find the expected one.\nThat is understandable, because when we use the pattern %search_string%, the database have no choice than loop through the whole table and perform comparing one by one.\nBut, what about pattern text%, you only put % at the end of search string, from my understanding, the database can use index to compare in this case.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 postgres=# explain analyze select * from grades where name like \u0026#39;00d4e4727e671%\u0026#39;; QUERY PLAN ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gather (cost=1000.00..12953.24 rows=89 width=23) (actual time=101.556..107.356 rows=0 loops=1) Workers Planned: 2 Workers Launched: 2 -\u0026gt; Parallel Seq Scan on grades (cost=0.00..11944.34 rows=37 width=23) (actual time=32.084..32.085 rows=0 loops=3) Filter: (name ~~ \u0026#39;00d4e4727e671%\u0026#39;::text) Rows Removed by Filter: 333334 Planning Time: 2.530 ms Execution Time: 107.742 ms (8 rows) This is weird, the database still perform and expensive sequence scan.\nAfter a while of searching on the internet, I found another option when creating index on text column, it is text_pattern_ops.\n1 2 DROP INDEX IF EXISTS name_index; CREATE INDEX name_index ON grades (name text_pattern_ops); Let\u0026rsquo;s see if the new index improve the query time:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 postgres=# explain analyze select * from grades where name like \u0026#39;00d4e4727e671%\u0026#39;; QUERY PLAN --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Index Scan using name_index on grades (cost=0.42..8.45 rows=89 width=23) (actual time=0.172..0.174 rows=0 loops=1) Index Cond: ((name ~\u0026gt;=~ \u0026#39;00d4e4727e671\u0026#39;::text) AND (name ~\u0026lt;~ \u0026#39;00d4e4727e672\u0026#39;::text)) Filter: (name ~~ \u0026#39;00d4e4727e671%\u0026#39;::text) Planning Time: 4.601 ms Execution Time: 0.475 ms (5 rows) It does! The database uses index scan instead of sequence scan like before, query time is significantly reduced.\nI also did tests on patterns like %search_string% or %search_string, as expected, the text_pattern_ops index can\u0026rsquo;t help. To understand why text_pattern_ops helps the search with pattern search_string%, please read the links that are attached in the References section below.\nConclusion If the column doesn’t have an index, query times of = and like are quite similar.\nIf the column has an index, it reduces significant query time of = operator. whereas, the like operator can’t use index to improve query time.\nBut there is an index option that lets database using index while performing the like operator, it is text_pattern_ops. With this option on, you can use like operator with a pattern like search_string%.\nReferences https://thoughtbot.com/blog/reading-an-explain-analyze-query-plan

Because the letter Z stands for UTC 0.\nSo when you query, you can convert timestamp to timestamp with time zone +7, by using at time zone:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 select id, title, artist, price,

SSL is a method to encrypt your data before transmitting it to the receiver. If we don’t encrypt and send data as plain text, somebody can sniff in your connection to read all your messages.\nHow do SSL works? Of course, to establish an SSL, we need a TCP connection first, let’s assume that we have a TCP connection ready.\nHow an SSL connection is established The client says hello to the server by sending a request with the below data: TLS version client supports (1.0 2.0 ..). cipher suites client supports (algorithm). a random byte: client random. The server says hello to the client by sending a request with the below data: Server’s SSL certificate. the server’s chosen cipher suites. a random byte: server random. The client verifies the SSL certification of the server against its list of Certificate Authorities (CA) generate a pre-master secret encrypted the secret with the server public key and sent it back to the server Server using its the private key to decrypt the pre-master secret using the agreed cipher. Both server and client now can generate the master secret based on client random, server random and pre-master secret. From now on, data transmitting between server and client will be encrypted symmetrically using master secret. Read more about the SSL handshake.\nCan SSL be faked? An SSL usually contains some information like owner/organization, its location public key, validity dates,…\nFor example, if a hacker wants to fake a Google service, he will make a UI look exactly like Google, with the URL slightly different. Since Google adopt SSL so he wants to fake an SSL certificate as well:\nGenerate a new pair of the public and private key Generate a new SSL cert that has information that looks exactly like the one of Google How do they prevent that? That is when CA – Certificate Authority comes into play. To generate an SSL cert is quite simple, but that is not enough, you need to register your SSL cert with a CA as well, and they make sure you can’t register a fake URL.\nThis situation is similar to someone trying to fake me, my name is Khanh and he claims that his name is Khanh too? So how do others differentiate me and the fake one? In real life, we have an organization that issues ID cards, each citizen has a unique ID, if you want to verify where I am the real Khanh, then take the ID and verify with the ID issuing organization because we trust them.\nSo CA is basically a third party that we trust at them, and an SSL is like a citizen ID in real life. They also have paired public and private keys. Conceptually, your certification will be encrypted by their private key, and their public is installed in your browser and OS.\nEvery computer comes with a set of CA public keys out of the box. When the client receives the SSL cert from the server, they will decode the cert using the public key of CA, if it can, then it means the Cert is valid.\nReplay attack Replay Attack Do you wonder why the master secret – the symmetric key used for encrypted data – is made of: client random + server random + pre-master secret?\nWhen we use only pre-master secret as a master secret:\nMan in the middle (MiM) can catch your packet, but he can’t decrypt your data. He will catch all of your packets and resend them from begging of the SSL handshake, event client hello,… That lead to the hacker now will have another connection that has the same master secret as the user The hacker can’t know the secret and the information but he doesn’t need it. He catches your packet and resends it to the server, it is able to decrypt the message since it has the same master secret. So what can the hacker do to make some damage? For example, you order one cup of coffee, but he can resend your request 10 more times, and now you have 11 cups of coffee. Or resend the login request to get an authentication token.\nHow to prevent that?\nIn SSL, the server will assign and send to each client a random unique value. If the hacker catch and resend every one of your packets since the beginging of the SSL handshake, he will have a connection, but the server random value is different (step server hello). The hacker cannot take a packet of the user and resend it after that because the server randomly is not the same as the user.\nWhy don’t we use asymmetric keys to exchange data? Each server has a pair of public and private keys, why don’t the client just encrypt data with the public key, and the server can decrypt data using the private key. Vice versa, the server encrypts data with a private key, and the client decrypts using the public key. Those are based on characteristics of an asymmetric key.\nBecause encrypting data using a symmetric key (the master secret) is faster and needs fewer resources when compared to an asymmetric key.\nReferences https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cics-tg-multi/9.2?topic=ssl-how-connection-is-established\n","permalink":"https://khanh1998.github.io/posts/note-in-ssl-tls/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-ssl-and-why-do-we-need-them\"\u003eWhat is SSL? and why do we need them?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSSL is a method to encrypt your data before transmitting it to the receiver.

I define a new Person class that has two properties age and name. And then I defined a map, to check if a person join the event or not.\nSo I have a person named John, at first he join, but the next day he change his mind and don’t want to join the event anymore because he got a ton of home need to finish 🤕. So my expectation here is when I check if John joins the event, the result should be False.\nLet’s see how it goes! kinda weird 🤔 So on the map, you can see two records with the same values of name and age. The first record is for the time John registered for the event, the second one is the time John withdraw from the event. That is not correct, I expect that there should be only one record in the map representing John.\nAnd lastly, I want to check if John join the event by accessing the map, it doesn’t even know who is John :’)\nHaha, but I am a good student, I work very hard at university, these problems can’t trouble me :D. I remember that in a hash map before putting a pair of keys and values in, it will hash the key to getting a number to find the position of the bucket in the map for this key. So every pair have the same hash will go into the same bucket.\nSo let’s see the hash values of these John objects.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 john = Person(\u0026#39;John\u0026#39;, 18) print(john.__hash__()) john = Person(\u0026#39;John\u0026#39;, 18) print(john.__hash__()) john = Person(\u0026#39;John\u0026#39;, 18) print(john.__hash__()) Let’s see how it goes! Exactly what I expected, despite three John objects all having the same values in their properties, they have different hash values, so they will consider as different objects, and will be put in different buckets on the map.\nSo what is the solution? Haha 😂 pretty simple, I only need to override the hash function of the Person class, so every Person object with the same values in their properties will have the same hash.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 class Person: def __init__(self, name: str, age: int) -\u0026gt; None: self.name = name self.age = age def __repr__(self) -\u0026gt; str: return f\u0026#39;{self.name} {self.age}\u0026#39; def __hash__(self) -\u0026gt; int: return hash((self.name, self.age)) 1 2 3 4 5 6 john = Person(\u0026#39;John\u0026#39;, 18) print(john.__hash__()) john = Person(\u0026#39;John\u0026#39;, 18) print(john.__hash__()) john = Person(\u0026#39;John\u0026#39;, 18) print(john.__hash__()) So three John objects with the same values in their properties have the same hash value now. So my first code snippet should work now, haha oops 😬 what wrong? oops 😬 what wrong?\nAfter an hour of searching on the internet, I just remember how a hash map works. GeeksForGeeks I guess, in Python hashmap, they use chaining as a method to handle hashing collision 💥. Hashing collision happens when two different keys have the same hash. In the chaining method, each bucket in the hash map does not contain a pair but a list of pairs. So every pair whose key has the same hash value will be appended to that list.\nThe problem here is, how do you know if your pair (key, value) has been already on the list or not? Pretty simple, using __eq__ function to compare objects, we will iterate through every pair in the list and compare it to the new pair, if the new pair haven’t been in the list, we append it to the list. So the next thing we need to do is to override the __eq__ function.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 class Person: def __init__(self, name: str, age: int) -\u0026gt; None: self.name = name self.age = age def __repr__(self) -\u0026gt; str: return f\u0026#39;{self.name} {self.age}\u0026#39; def __hash__(self) -\u0026gt; int: return hash((self.name, self.age)) def __eq__(self, __o: object) -\u0026gt; bool: return self.age == __o.age and self.name == __o.name Everything work now hahaha 🤣🤣🤣 hard work payoff.\nReferences

I can see that the B tree and AVL tree have a thing in common – it is all self-balance. But the difference is, each node in the AVL tree store exactly one value, and have at most two children. Each node of the B tree contains an array of at most N values and has at most N + 1 children.\nI am not gonna go into details about the B tree or B+ tree, you can read it on Wikipedia.\nHere are two very good demos on B tree and B+ tree, you can try them to understand how those trees work.\nHow does data get stored on a disk? The basic unit of a disk is a block. The size of a block is usually 512MB, which means that when you read, you have to read a whole block of 512MB. If you write, you have to write to a 512MB block.\n512MB is really large, so the database usually stores multiple records in the same block.\nIndex Database stores data in disk, so how do they find a specific record? Well, they have to scan through every record in the table to find your expected record, and IO operations are expensive. But that is when the database doesn’t have an index.\nIn simple words, an index is a way to map from a record identifier to its location on a disk. When using create a table, it usually comes with an index on the ID field, so that index is the mapping from ID to its record location on disk. Because the database stores multiple rows in a disk block, so, the location here is not exactly the location of the expected record, but the location of the block that contains the record. The database will read the whole block and return to you your desired record.\nSo, where does the indexes get stored? Well, on disk. Basically, indexes are additional data structures, it requires more space on the disk to store them.\nSo when a database wants to use an index, it has to read indexes from the disk.\nIs it slow? Yes, at first. The only needed block will be loaded to RAM, not all blocks of the index. But when a block gets accessed frequently, it will be cached, which could increase the performance.\nI have thought why wouldn’t load the whole index to RAM so we can access it quickly. Because the Index could be really big, and the idea of bringing the whole index to RAM is not possible.\nWhy B tree is a good fit for the database index? Why don’t use something like an AVL tree?\nAs I mentioned before, where we store data to disk, the basic unit is 512MB, so we want to put data to block as much as possible.\nSo each block now will store a list of mapping from Identifier to record block location.\nWhy B+ tree even better than Btree? The problem is IO operations are expensive and slow, so we want to avoid them, and the B+ tree helps us do that.\nB+ tree only stores key (or identifier) in a non-leaf node, which means one block now can store more mapping than before. B tree stores a list of pairs of a key and a location on a non-leaf node, it stores fewer mapping items per disk block.\nLet say, when using the B tree, we can store 100 mapping per disk block, but the B+ tree could possibly store 150 mapping per disk block.\nWhat does it mean? Each node in the B tree can have at most 101 children, but the B+ tree has at most 151 children. Each node in the B+ tree can store more information make the tree shorter when compared with the B tree.\nIn other words, in my example, read a block in B tree has time complexity O(log(n/100)), while the B+ tree has smaller time complexity O(log(n/150)). Where n = number of rows.\nDisadvantages of B+ tree When you use the B+ tree, even you found the key that you want, you still have to travel to the leaf node to take the value – location of the disk block contains the desired record.\nReferences https://stackoverflow.com/a/870324 https://stackoverflow.com/a/1130\n","permalink":"https://khanh1998.github.io/posts/b-tree-and-indexing-in-database/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"b-tree-and-b-tree\"\u003eB tree and B+ tree\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eB tree is a self-balance tree.

Example:\nTransaction A Transaction B begin transaction; select age from employee where id = 1; // age = 24 begin transaction; update employee set age = 25 where id = 1; // age = 25 select age from employee where id = 1; // age = 25 rollback; select age from employee where id = 1; // age = 24 commit; 1.2 Non-repeatable reads When during a transaction, you retrieve a row two times, and the second time, you got a slightly different row. It is different from the dirty read in that this time, it read committed data.\nTransaction A Transaction B begin transaction; select age from employee where id = 1; // age = 24 begin transaction; update employee set age = 25 where id = 1; // age = 25 commit; select age from employee where id = 1; // age = 25 commit; 1.3 Phantom read When during a transaction, you perform two queries, and the number of rows you got each time is different due to some other transaction inserting or deleting new data.\nTransaction A Transaction B begin transaction; select * from employee where age \u0026gt; 18 and age \u0026lt; 24; // 4 rows begin transaction; insert into employee(id, age) values(20); commit; select * from employee where age \u0026gt; 18 and age \u0026lt; 24; // 5 rows commit; 1.4 Serialization anomaly https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/315353\n2. Isolation level 2.1 Read uncommitted Transaction A could see uncommitted changes from Transaction B, in other words, it allows** dirty read** to happen.\n2.2 Read committed Transaction A could see committed changes from Transaction B. No dirty read at this level, but non-repeatable read and phantom read are possible.\n2.3 Repeatable reads It inherits from read-committed, and no non-repeatable read in this level, it means that no matter how many times you query for a row in a single transaction, you are a warranty that all the values in the row remain unchanged.\nBut phantom read could happen at this level.\n2.4 Serializable Not any read phenomena could happen at this level, this is the highest level of isolation.\nIn the Serializable Isolation Level, all transactions have to execute in sequential order, it cannot be executed in parallel like in the Repeatable level.\n3. Default Isolation level in Postgres The default isolation level of Postgres is Read Committed.\nThere is no way to read uncommitted in Postgres.\nPhantom-read is prevented even in Repeatable reads Isolation Level.\n4.

Atomicity means that the transaction is considered a success if all steps are a success.

There is nothing to say if all transactions are not trying to access or modify the same data, but in reality, they do a lot. So, the goal of isolation is to ensure that executing multiple transactions at the same time does not lead to a consistent state. They usually use a lock to achieve isolation in the database.\nDurability: This may be the easiest term to understand in ACID. Durability means once I have committed my transaction, my data will be in the database whenever I need it.

Your computer then will be assigned a local IP by a DHCP server (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), you cannot use that local IP to talk to the outside network. All the devices in the same local network will use the IP of the gateway to talk to the internet, sometimes it’s called public IP. The protocol to map from local address to public address is called NAT (Network Address Translation).\nGoogle.com is a URL, the computer doesn’t understand those names, they made those up so the human can remember them easier.\nTherefore, the first thing is to convert google.com to an IP address. The computer can do that using DNS protocol, each ISP will have a default DNS server, or you also can choose the DNS server that you want. So now you will have the IP of the server and be ready to make a connection.\nNow, the client will make a TCP connection to the server using a “three ways handshake“. After that, if we use HTTPS, then right after TCP connection is established, TLS/SSL handshake will happen, the server will send a TLS/SSL Certification and it’s the public key to the client, the client then verify to see if the certificate is valid or not.\nWhen the TCP connection is ready, the client can use HTTP/HTTPS protocol over TCP/IP protocol to talk to the server to request resources.\nHTTP -\u0026gt; TCP -\u0026gt; IP -\u0026gt; PPP\nTCP is a protocol to exchange messages between two processes, could be in the same or different machine. We usually see TCP come with IP, IP is another protocol to exchange messages between two hosts.\nBellow IP protocol could be PPP (Point to Point Protocol). So the IP package is transferred by PPP, and PPP doesn’t use an IP address, it uses MAC Address instead. So there is an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to get MAC addresses of surrounding hosts.\n","permalink":"https://khanh1998.github.io/posts/what-happen-when-you-use-a-browser-to-access-google/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSo this is just a quick recap of what I have learned about networking\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, you have to connect your computer to the local network.
